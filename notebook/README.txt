Using the application:

This application is built to be fully accessible for users restricted to a mouse-only method of input.  In order to 
maximize the efficiency of mouse-based text input, we've created an intuitive on-screen keyboard to assist you.  To
enter text into any field in this application, simply <strong>right-click the field</strong>, and the keyboard will appear.  
By clicking and dragging the keyboard, you can move it to an optimal location for your needs.
